These examples showcase how to use sympy to do Kinematic analysis of mechanisms and then have online nice visualizations


For visualizations outside matplotlib we should have something that allows to have interactive game-type of UI so that the demos are nice. 

I propose using either Three js or Panda3D

Panda 3D is native python. I think that is a better option for local quick demos.
Three js is great to have online applets like on a website. The interactivity can be achieved as well (I think).
